### What I contributed
Force Interaction #1,2,3,6
Much of my effort was put into the force grab controller script as well as designing particle effects, sound effects, and dynamic props to make the environment feel more alive.
This project was very interesting but also very limited on time. I feel like what I have now is just a demo but it could be refined further to make it a full-fledged game that I would be proud to put on my portfolio/resume. With more time I would have added the ability to force grab groups of objects, added more SFX, especially for lightsaber collision and swings, and finalized the game loop. I think development would have been better paced over 2 projects. The first project should be focused on dialing in the force interactions and the second should focus on environment, effects, and sounds. This way students can spend more time refining the XR inputs which I found to be the most valuable learning experience from this first project.

### Bugs
Force-throwing objects at enemies instantly destroys them but should only take off 1 health. 
The lightning particle effect loops infinitely on one hand when input is held.
The lightsaber falls through the floor with no consistent reason.
The blade of the lightsaber will sometimes get slightly offset when using force on it.
I had to remove the lightsaber collision noises cause it would collide with the handle and make constant noise.
