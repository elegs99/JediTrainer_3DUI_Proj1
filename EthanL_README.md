### What I contributed

With more time I would have added the ability to force grab groups of objects.

### Bugs
Force-throwing objects at enemies instantly destroys them but should only take off 1 health. 
The lightning particle effect loops infinitely on one hand when input is held.
The lightsaber falls through the floor with no consistent reason.
The blade of the lightsaber will sometimes get slightly offset when using force on it.
Had to remove the lightsaber collision noises cause it would constantly collide with the handle and just make noise.
